I‚Äôd look forward to going to his class. - Quizzes and personal LTs are related to the lesson; not the type to give that many curveballs.

He is super strict with solutions, and gives deductions for the smallest of errors. Therefore, he grades kinda low.   I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs good training though! It practices you towrite elegant and solid solutions.   BUUUT, honestly, can‚Äôt blame him for grading that way! After every test, if you mess up, you know it‚Äôs because of personal carelessness or lack of studying because he‚Äôs that good and organized in teaching!  Tip:  - He‚Äôll probably say something like this in the first few sessions but write your solutions like you‚Äôre writing an essay! Don‚Äôt have stray equations and make sure to use the right ‚Äúpunctuation marks‚Äù (only put the = when necessary, be careful with too many arrows, etc.) - Do old exams (!!!)

The Lt involved manually plugging in raw data into the computer software from paper to get the needed computed data.

She's also understanding and open minded to people that may have certain triggers, mental disorders, etc. She also applies lots of the lessons to her own experiences and asks the class to share their own experiences too, and she respects everyone's privacies as there may or may not be moments where you talk about sensitive information in class. She's also very organized with her lectures and has a quiz after every chapter and an LT after every two chapters, and gives a lot of bonuses here and there to pull up your grade. Sometimes she's too fast lang pero you can ask her to adjust to the pace of the class naman. Our tests were always multiple choice but you have to be careful lang for some trick questions. Workload's pretty heavy since she normally gives an additional assignment per chapter and you have to keep up with all the work she gives you.

Camacho on the other hand started teaching only last semester but he\\'s super duper chill! He doesn\\'t look it, but he\\'s a fun geeky (a lil awkward but that\\'s okay he jokes) type of person.

She\\'s motherly in the sense that she\\'s the type you really want to please because you just want to give back for the things she teaches you. You\\'ll find her inspiring!

She also has a group reporting in the end, so make sure you get good group mates because it takes 20%-30% of your grade.

You can get an A but you need constant A's in her LTs and quizzes. She has around 4-5 LTs one is cancellable in a normal semester not during the summer. She also has a group reporting in the end, so make sure you get good group mates because it takes 20%-30% of your grade. There was an instance in class where she kept questioning one group so much on their reporting because it wasn't correct to the point that a group member cried afterwards.

Her quizzes and LT's were moderate, but she grades a little harsher than other math profs, so if you get her make sure you solve the problems the way she would in class.

If you've adjusted na to ME math & you have a solid study group I think you'll do fine!  But don't get me wrong I really cried so many times cause I didn't know what was going on.

She consistently begins and ends class on time, and is almost never absent. She marks tardiness/absence diligently and grades slightly better than you would expect. Overall, she feels like a high school teacher in a bad way. My experience under her as a Math 10 prof was not at all delightful‚Äîperhaps the worst math class I have ever taken in my life. That being said, I feel that she was simply not used to teaching Math 10. She is obviously very passionate about what she does, and may even excel in teaching Math 30.23 (whatever it is). Good luck',\n",

I took her again during intercession so we had homeworks daily and quizzes every week. She still took cutting and lates against people by warning them and their friends. You can get an A but you need constant A's in her LTs and quizzes. She has around 4-5 LTs one is cancellable in a normal semester not during the summer. She also has a group reporting in the end, so make sure you get good group mates because it takes 20%-30% of your grade. There was an instance in class where she kept questioning one group so much on their reporting because it wasn't correct to the point that a group member cried afterwards. In all honesty, her comments weren't constructive and they were very harsh. Still motherly tho, but if you're willing to go through lectures about math and life in one class... this is for you\",\n",

One of his exams was Avengers-themed since Endgame came out during that time lol. His jokes are usually hit-or-miss, but some were funny if you get them. Not sure about the Scooby-Doo comment, but he did tell us to wear yellow during our exams for good luck. He's really a passionate prof who wants to help people appreciate math. I think as long as you don't slack off, he's definitely A-able in MATH 10.  P.S, If y'all behave, he'll libre you guys Shakeys ^_^\",\n",

Kung na-aamaze ka sa solutions na pinepresent niya, maganda yun, kasi naacknowledge mo yung solution as something na abstract at most of the time, out of the blue and ideas. Tip na lang, kopyahin mo style niya if ayaw mo mabawasan ng points sa solution. May times na kahit tama ang sagot mo, may bawas pa rin dahil mali/incomplete solution. Sa case ng incomplete solution, for example gumamit ka ng shortcut or ng theorem na HINDI PA NADIDISCUSS, mababawasan ka ng points, at masakit siya magbawas haha (unless i prove mo muna yung ginamit mong theorem sa exam, bibigyan ka nya full credit pag naprove mo).

Don‚Äôt assume this applies for Math 30.23 She has a tendency to stray off topic when discussing. She also gives the most unreasonably difficult quizzes with regards to the reading/s given that I have ever experienced. She does give group assigned readings and has those groups ‚Äúteach‚Äù the rest of the class over the course of several sessions. Expect lots of groupwork, group defense included. She consistently begins and ends class on time, and is almost never absent. She marks tardiness/absence diligently and grades slightly better than you would expect. Overall, she feels like a high school teacher in a bad way. My experience under her as a Math 10 prof was not at all delightful‚Äîperhaps the worst math class I have ever taken in my life. That being said, I feel that she was simply not used to teaching Math 10. She is obviously very passionate about what she does, and may even excel in teaching Math 30.23 (whatever it is).

She also has a group reporting in the end, so make sure you get good group mates because it takes 20%-30% of your grade. There was an instance in class where she kept questioning one group so much on their reporting because it wasn't correct to the point that a group member cried afterwards.
